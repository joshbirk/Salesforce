#Salesforce Smart Refrigerator

The following Trailhead project will use the Electric Imp platform to monitor a refrigerator and a Salesforce *Connected App* to track the current temperature and humidity in the fridge.  This example will also *open a case* in Salesforce if:  1) the refrigerator door is open for more than 30 seconds, or 2) the temperature remains over 11°C for more than 15 min, or 3) the relative humidity is over 70% for more than 15 min.  To track the current temperature and humidity we will create a Salesforce *custom object*, then update it with new readings every 15 sec.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Setup the Electric Imp hardware

First we will need to assemble the Electric Imp Developer Kit.  The kit comes with (1) the imp001 card, which includes a WiFi radio and microcontroller that drives all the logic for the board  (2) the breakout board into which the card fits and (3) an environmental sensor "tail".  A tail is a specific kind of board which connects to the breakout board and provides a set of sensors or other peripherals that are ready to use.  For this project the environmental sensor tail will read temperature, humidity and light to determine the current state of your fridge.

#### Hardware Setup
 - Plug the imp001 card into the breakout board slot 
 - Connect the Env Sensor tail to the April breakout board
 - Power up your Imp with the USB cable and power adapter
 - The imp001 should now have power and be blinking amber/red

Assmbled it should look like this:

#### Electric Imp BlinkUp

Use the Electric Imp mobile app to BlinkUp your device

 - Log into your Electric Imp account
 - Enter your WIFI credentials
 - Follow the instructions in the app to [BlinkUp](https://electricimp.com/platform/blinkup/) your device

 If you have any issues getting started with your Electric Imp account or device, see [the full getting started guide](https://electricimp.com/docs/gettingstarted/quickstartguide/).

### Step 2: Add Code for the Electric Imp

#### How Electric Imp's cloud based programming works

The Electric Imp IDE provides all the tools you need to write and deploy the software that will control your imp-enabled connected product. The IDE runs in a desktop web browser and communicates between the device and cloud solutions.  Here is a broad overview of the flow between the device code, the agent code and the Salesforce:

![Salesforce Case Custom Field](http://i.imgur.com/UuEJDnh.png)

### Step 6: Build and Run the Electric Imp Application

These examples use OAuth 2.0 for authentication, so the agent has been set up as a web server to handle the log in.
Go to the Electric Imp IDE and select your device from the sidebar for the final setup steps.

- Hit **Build and Run** to save and launch the code
- Click on the agent url (at the top of the agent coding window) to launch the log in page
- Log into salesforce

![IDE Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/kMU3Qio.png)

Your App should now be up and running.  You can monitor the device logs in the IDE, or log into Salesforce web prortal to see updates there.

### Step 7: Install Device in Refrigerator

Open your refrigerator and tape the Imp and Env Tail inside with the sensors facing away from the refrigerator ceiling/wall.

Run the USB cable to the outside of the refrigerator and plug into power.

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/BUuEpjt.png" width="400">

If you don't have a fridge handy for this scenario, you can also test the door being open or close by shining a bright light against the Environment Sensor board.  A door open for thirty seconds should register a case.

### Step 8: Monitor the data in Salesforce1

Now that you have connected your Imp to Salesforce, it might be handy to see that data on a mobile device.  Using Salesforce1, it is easy to keep track of your Smart Fridge on the go.


#### Create a Custom Object Tab
First, let's give the custom object a tab so that Salesforce1 can add it to the left navigation.

1. Go to Setup
2. Under *Create*, click *Tabs*
3. Next to "Custom Object Tabs", click *New*
4. In the objects drop down, select "SmartFridge"
5. Select an Icon
6. Click "Save"


#### Open Salesforce1 in Chrome
You can access the Salesforce1 mobile app in three ways:

*As a downloadable mobile app (Salesforce1) that you install on your phone from the Apple AppStore or Google Play
*By navigating to login.salesforce.com using a mobile browser
*By using the Chrome Developer Tools

For this step, we'll use the last option.

Open a new tab in your Chrome browser and open the Developer Tools by clicking View | Developer | Developer Tools
Click the Toggle Device Mode button to simulate your browser as a mobile device.

1.To simulate the Salesforce1 app in your browser, copy and paste in the URL from the previous tab. Remove the part of the URL immediately after salesforce.com/.

2. Append /one/one.app to the end of the URL after salesforce.com to start the Salesforce1 Application simulator. For example:
image

3. If the display is too small, change the size to 100%.

4. Click the three white bars in the upper left to open the left navigation

5. Under the "Recent" section, scroll down and click "More"

6. You will see "SmartFridge" somewhere on the list.  Select it and you can now browse the readings as if it it were on a mobile device.


### Step 9: Use Process Builder to Chatter Fridge data

Finally, let's add some finesse to our application by using Process Builder to drive a Chatter conversation based on the incoming readings which create the case.


#### Create a new Process Builder
1. Go to Setup
2. Go to Create | Workflows & Approvals | Process Builder
3. Click "New"
4. Name the new Process "Post Chatter for Smart Fridge"


#### Setup the Process Criteria
1. Click "Add Object" and for "Find an Object" select "Case"
2. Leave the process at "only when a record is created"
3. Click "Add Criteria" and name it "Related to Smart Fridge"
4. Under set conditions, click "Find a Field".
5. Use field selector to find "Related Fridge" and then "Related Fridge"
6. Under "Operator" select "Is Null"
7. Leave "Boolean" and "False"
8. Click "Save"

#### Create the Action
1. Under "Immediate Actions" next to the new criteria, click "Add Action"
2. Under Action Type, select "Post to Chatter"
3. Under Action name, type "Post Smart Fridge Data"
4. Under "Post To", select "User", "Select a User from a Record" and then pick the OwnerID field
5. In the message section, type a message using the merge field lookup which reads something like "A case ({![Case].Id}) was opened related to Smart Fridge {![Case].Related_Fridge__c.DeviceId__c}.  It was recorded at a temperature of {![Case].Related_Fridge__c.Temperature__c}, humidity of {![Case].Related_Fridge__c.Temperature__c}{![Case].Related_Fridge__c.Humidity__c} and the door with a status of {![Case].Related_Fridge__c.Door__c}."
6. Click Save
7. Click "Activate"

Now whenever a case is created that has a related Smart Fridge, the important data about that fridge will be accessible right from the case owners's chatter feed.
